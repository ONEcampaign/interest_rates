# Downloading files from data.one.org

Files can be downloaded from the main branch, or through github pages. Only the `output` folder is published to github pages

To download from github pages follow this structure:
https://onecampaign.github.io/interest_rates/{file_name}

The filenames refer to files inside the `/output/` folder. Therefore there's no need to refer to that folder in the url.
